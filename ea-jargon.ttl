Non-relational databases have been designed with the cloud in mind, making them great at horizontal scaling.

        There are a few different groups of database types that store the data in different ways:
        Document Databases - store data in documents, which are usually JSON-like structures that support a variety of data types. 
        Key-Value Databases - This is the most basic type of database, where information is stored in two parts: key and value.
        Graph Databases - Graph databases are the most specialized of the non-relational database types. They use a structure of elements called nodes that store data, and edges between them contain attributes about the relationship. Relationships are defined in the edges, which makes searches related to these relationships naturally fast. Plus, they are flexible because new nodes and edges can be added easily. They also don't have to have a defined schema like a traditional relational database.
        Wide-column databases - Wide-column databases, similar to relational databases, store data in tables, columns, and rows. However, the names and formatting of the columns don't have to match in each row. The columns can even be stored across multiple servers. They are considered two-dimensional key-value stores because they use multi-dimensional mapping to reference data by row and column."""@en ;
