        Overseas engineers who intend to apply for permanent residence in Australia under the Skilled Migration Program must have their qualifications and skills assessed by Engineers Australia before they lodge their migration application. Engineers Australia assesses overseas qualifications under a contract to AEI-NOOSR, a branch of the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training. If an applicant appeals against an assessment outcome the case is reviewed by an honorary Committee of Review. The Migration Skills Assessment Unit does not assess persons who are already Australian Permanent Residents or Citizens. These persons must apply for an assessment using the Stage 1 Competency Assessment process."""@en ;
