    There are 13 Australian Privacy Principles and they govern standards, rights and obligations around:
    - the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
    - an organisation or agency's governance and accountability
    - integrity and correction of personal information
    - the rights of individuals to access their personal information
    The Australian Privacy Principles are principles-based law. This gives an organisation or agency flexibility to tailor their personal information handling practices to their business models and the diverse needs of individuals. They are also technology neutral, which allows them to adapt to changing technologies.
    
    A breach of an Australian Privacy Principle is an 'interference with the privacy of an individual' and can lead to regulatory action and penalties."""@en ;

CPD is the systematic, accountable maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge and skills, and the development of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional and technical duties throughout an engineering practitioner's career.

    Continuing professional development is undertaken by engineering practitioners for the purposes of developing or maintaining the currency of the skills and knowledge necessary for ongoing competent engineering practice.
    
    Maintaining CPD requirements also ensures Engineers Australia Chartered or NER credentials stay valid.
    
    CPD is any sort of training or learning that helps to expand knowledge, maintain technical skills and progress the career of an engineer. Good CPD should facilitate:
    - maintainance of technical competence
    - retention and enhancement of workplace effectiveness
    - development of good leadership and mentoring skills
    - successful navigation of career challenges
    - better service to the community.
    
    For engineers wishing to retain their Chartered or Engineering Executive Status there is an obligation to achieve a minimum of 150 hours of structured CPD over a three-year period. Of the recommended 150 hours in three years: A proportion of CPD should relate to one's area of practice (a minimum of 50 hours in the three-year period is recommended.

By extension, a meta-model translates from real world objects to data entities and is a model of other data models.

        Where a canonical data model will define the data entities within a domain shared across systems, a meta-model defines why those data entities exist in the data model, what class of object those entities belong to, and therefore how they will be represented by the data. For example, a canonical model may describe customers, employees, contractors, volunteers in seperate tables, whereas the metamodel defines these as subclasses of Relationships between EA and its various contacts, and by extension defines a common core of attributes expected for all subclasses of agent-to-agent relationships.

        Meta-models describes what elements and classes of objects constitute a domain, their attributes, and their relationships to each other. Meta Models provide the framework to create other models by describing criteria for the defintion of classes of concepts in a system-independent manner.
