The CDR is a report on career episodes in which the applicant relates their experiences to the competency units, elements and performance criteria in a manner similar to preparing a job application. 
        
    The CDR replaced Test by Examination as a means of determining the standing of an applicant. Normally overseas qualified, applicant's formal academic qualifications have permitted them to practice in the occupational category of professional engineer, engineering technologist or engineering associate in the country where the qualifications were obtained. However, Engineers Australia is unable to verify as equivalent standing in Australia. If the CDR is accepted, the Engineers Australia Qualifications Assessors may issue either a letter of eligibility, which is then accepted as evidence of Stage 1 eligibility for membership purposes, or a letter which may be used by the applicant to support his / her Migration application. The CDR is similar to the Engineering Practice Report required for Stage 2 applications, but is less comprehensive and focuses primarily on enabling competencies."""@en ;
